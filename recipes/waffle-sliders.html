    <h2>Mini Hot Chicken and Waffle Sliders</h2>
    <p>
      If you like hot chicken, you'll love these mini sliders. The waffles are
      slightly sweet and pair perfectly with the salty chicken and spicy sauce.
      Dill pickles and slaw add tang and crunch, delivering the perfect bite.
    </p>
    <p>
      They're easy to make and I promise, they'll be the hit of the party! A fun
      addition to a brunch menu, and great for a football party alongside an ice
      cold beer.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package frozen chicken nuggets</li>
      <li>¼ cup butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground paprika</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon water, or more if needed</li>
      <li>1 (11 ounce) package mini waffles (such as Kellogg's® Eggo®)</li>
      <li>1 cup prepared slaw</li>
      <li>20 small dill pickle slices</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet
        with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 20 chicken nuggets in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.
        Reserve any remaining nuggets for another use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake nuggets in the preheated oven for 6 minutes. Flip and bake until
        crispy, 5 to 7 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, prepare sauce: Heat butter, maple syrup, canola oil, brown
        sugar, paprika, cayenne, kosher salt, garlic powder, and black pepper in
        a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until smooth
        and well combined, 3 to 5 minutes. If sauce thickens too much, reduce
        heat to low and whisk in 1 to 2 tablespoons water. Keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        As the sauce is cooking, toast waffles, then separate each one into 4
        mini waffles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble sliders: Place a chicken nugget on top of a waffle and top with
        1 heaping teaspoon slaw. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon sauce, top with a
        pickle slice, and place a second waffle on top. Secure slider with a
        toothpick or skewer, if desired. Repeat to make remaining sliders. Serve
        with extra sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
