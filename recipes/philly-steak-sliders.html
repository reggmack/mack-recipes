    <h2>Philly Steak And Cheese Sliders</h2>
    <p>A quick and easy take on a Philly steak and cheese sandwich.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound sirloin steak, cut into 1/8-inch strips</li>
      <li>1 pinch meat tenderizer</li>
      <li>1 splash olive oil</li>
      <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>Â½ cup minced bell pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, or to taste</li>
      <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 cups canned sliced mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 (12 count) package Hawaiian-style dinner rolls, sliced in half</li>
      <li>8 slices provolone cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's
        broiler. Mix steak and meat tenderizer together in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and bell pepper;
        cook and stir until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in steak
        mixture; cook and stir until flavors combine, about 3 minutes. Mix in
        Italian seasoning and pepper; add mushrooms. Cook and stir until steak
        is mostly browned, about 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon steak mixture onto lower half of dinner rolls until covered; top
        with provolone cheese. Place onto a baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Broil in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 1 to 3 minutes;
        remove from broiler. Place dinner roll tops onto melted provolone
        cheese; broil until tops are toasted, 1 to 2 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
