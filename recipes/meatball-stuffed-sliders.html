    <h2>Meatball-Stuffed Garlic Bread Sliders</h2>
    <p>
      We're getting close to the Super Bowl, and it's not about who wins the
      trophy, but rather who wins the snack table. If you show up with these
      super fun sliders, that will be you. The real secret to these beauties is
      placing the meatball in through the top of the roll, versus splitting and
      stuffing in the traditional manner.

    <p>
      Maybe it's the symmetry, or center of gravity, that makes these just feel
      right in your hand. If you're short on time, using pre-made meatballs will
      do.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
      <li>5 cloves garlic, minced, divided</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley, plus more for garnish</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>Â¼ cup plain bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded fontina cheese, divided</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>18 dinner rolls</li>
      <li>2 cups spicy tomato sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion
        and 2 cloves garlic; cook and stir until onion is soft, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place beef in a large bowl. Add onion-garlic mixture, parsley, egg,
        bread crumbs, and 1 large handful of fontina cheese, reserving the rest
        for topping. Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne. Mix by hand until
        just combined. Scoop meat mixture into 24 mini muffin cups; meatballs
        need not be perfectly round.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the centers, about 12
        minutes. Leave oven on. Let meatballs cool briefly while you make the
        garlic butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add remaining minced garlic
        once butter starts to bubble; stir, then immediately remove from heat.
        Stir well and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil; coat foil with remaining olive
        oil. Transfer rolls, still attached, to the baking sheet. Cut a hole in
        the top of each roll, about 2/3 of the way down. Brush garlic butter
        over the insides and outsides of the rolls.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Pour about 1 tablespoon tomato
        sauce into each hole. Stuff meatballs into the holes. Top each roll with
        a spoonful of tomato sauce and remaining fontina cheese. Sprinkle
        Parmesan cheese on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue baking until cheese is melted, 12 to 15 minutes. Garnish with
        more parsley. Let rolls sit for 5 to 10 minutes to firm up; transfer to
        a serving platter.
      </li>
    </ol>
